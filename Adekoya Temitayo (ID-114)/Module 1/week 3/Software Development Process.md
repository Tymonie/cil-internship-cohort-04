# Question 01: Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it'sbenefits in software development.

## Answer :
Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
The word scrum also is used in rugby to define a play where players struggle against each to gain possession of the ball. The goal of a scrum in software development is to perform at a high-performing level like a rugby team does in a scrum.

### Benefits of scrum includes:

- Better Product Quality

You will have better product quality if you’re checking in with your customers and stakeholders for evolving requirements during sprint reviews because they will be able to determine more quickly whether the software matches their needs.  When it’s not meeting their needs, you have the chance to pivot and change directions much earlier and much faster than in a waterfall project.  

Sprints are the time-boxed cadence of the Scrum framework.  The industry standard is typically 2-week cycles for these sprints.  That means you will show your product to your customers and stakeholders much earlier and far more frequently than in a typical waterfall project that might take 9 months to 2 years to complete. 

- Faster ROI

Faster ROI comes from delivering quality products that the customers can use in a shorter time frame.  Take TurboTax, rather than focus on software for all states and federal income at once, like a waterfall project might do, they break it down. Scrum would have them focus focus fist on the federal income tax return that everyone needs and then later on a key state or a small group of states. Every Sprint allows you to review and pivot depending on the feedback from customers and stakeholders. 

- Improved Customer Satisfaction

Business Value are Customer Satisfaction are two big wins with Scrum.  This is due to the fact that you have the potential for delivering real value in as quickly as two weeks! Starting at end of the very first Sprint, the customer is interacting with the product and giving feedback. This continues through the life of the project. Features and enhancements are driven much more by customers in Scrum which ultimately leads to a better product. Better products = happier customers. Another win stemming from regular customer engagement in the process is that customers feel deeply involved with the product - and even champion it - because they are helping to build it.  This makes Scrum development a winner for both improved business value and customer satisfaction.  

- More Control and Reduced Risk

Projects are more controlled because they are time-boxed and everyone knows what task they have to do.  When used properly, Scrum allows everyone in the project from customer to stakeholder, from developer to Scrum Master to know what they are doing and when it should be done.  Teams communicate and collaborate daily so there are less unknowns or crises that pop up out of nowhere.  Because you are working together more effectively through collaboration in Scrum, and are more focused, you will see reduced risk to the project.

In Scrum, cycle times are far shorter than on waterfall projects, often just 2 weeks to a month. If something is not going well, communication to stakeholders and customers occurs much more quickly even if only at the end of the sprint and this allows the team to pivot into corrective action far faster.  One of the issues often felt on projects is called the ‘caterpillar dilemma’.  This is when the customer doesn’t really know what they want, or can’t define it clearly, until we give them something to judge.

- MOTIVATED TEAMS FOR BETTER RESULTS

It is extremely important to be able to give the team members an overview of the project. In this sense, periodic deliveries allow them to see results in the short term and therefore transmit a sense of progress. After several iterations, the team finally realizes the true impact of each change made throughout the process. Each little detail is part of a great functionality, and seeing the effort reflected in results undoubtedly encourages the team to work.
