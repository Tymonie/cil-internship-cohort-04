# Question:

## Answer:

A)	5 Stakeholders Identification:

1)	Warren Randal------------------------Owner and Managing Director

2)	Ellie Martin and his team-------------Office Admin Staffs

3)	Rachel Scott---------------------------Production Manager

4)	Customers------------------------------(farm shops, delicatessens, restaurants and schools)

5)	Rhys Hawksby---------------------------Logistics Manager


B)	Each team because of their unique roles, I would be using different elicitation techniques as stated below.

1)	Warren Randal (Owner and Managing Director):
As the owner of the business, I would be using the prototyping and interview elicitation technique with him as most of his requirements are high level.

I.	The prototyping will enable me to show him a dummy of how the website will look like, different modules/ sections it is going to have including the preferred website colors. With is technique it would be easy to identify missing / unspecified requirements.

II.	The interview technique will help me to build a strong relationship with the owner who is a major stakeholder in this project, this technique encourages an interactive session that encourages clarification and provision of more details of the requirements at the shortest possible time.

2)	Ellie Martin and his team (Office Administrative Staffs):

Most of the jobs to make this first phase a success depends on the requirement gather from this stakeholder. Due to the volume of information needed from this team, I would be using the below elicitation techniques.

i.	Interviews: This requirement elicitation/ gathering would provide me in building closeness to the team and also to assure them that the project is not to put them out of job but to ease the process of job. This will encourage them to give me a more detail information about the job process, the challenges been encountered and suggestion of process they would like to improve.

ii.	Document analysis:  The document analysis technique allows me to get the necessary business documents study, understand and identify relevant business details. This will enable proper understanding of how the business operation is expected to work and help with the “As is” even though is manual to the anticipated platform.

iii.	 Observation: This technique gives me the opportunity to see how the job is done physically, observing them while working I would be able to observe and analysis which of the procedure is time consuming and proper way to reduce the operation timing. 

3)	Rachel Scott (Production Manager):

I.	Interview: For this first phase I would only use the interview technique to get the information I need from his side as what he needs is just information on customer’s order to plan her production.

4)	Customers (farm shops, delicatessens, restaurants and schools):

i.	Questionnaire/Survey: Customers feedbacks are very necessary in this kind of project as they would be putting up some information, due to their time availability and volume. I would be using this elicitation techniques to gather information from them concerning the proposed online purchase. The questionnaires shall have a response deadline between 48-72 hours to encourage quick response.

5)	Rhys Hawksby (Logistics Manager):

i.	Interview: The logistic manger is part of the management staff and needs to be carried along in this phase even though his interest is low at this point. I would interview him to also get information of what he knows about the business process and also open to some suggestion from him.
