# Question:

## Use MoSCoW to prioritise the requirements in the set, following on from your analysis in Exercise 2. Justify your decisions briefly.

## Notes: FR and NFRs should be assessed individually for prioritisation. Wherever there is ‘solution’ language used, make an assessment of the requirement ‘hidden’ there, and prioritise that. In practice of course this would have to be taken up and confirmed with the stakeholders concerned as soon as possible.
