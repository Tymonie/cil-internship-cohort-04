# Write an article on UI/UX Fundamentals

UX and UI are commonly used terms in the design world, but more often than not, they are incorrectly used as interchangeable terms. Although they work closely together and are both elements required in the design process.

UX design is the process of discovering user needs and designing solutions to meet them. If UX design is the art of carefully curating the experience a user will have when interacting with a certain product or service, UX designers are the artists who do the work of creating that experience.

UI design, also referred to as user interface design, refers to designing visual user interfaces in software or computerized devices. It’s the overall design, the way in which information is presented, and how your users interact with your website. Throughout the user interface design process, designers focus on either the look or style in order to achieve seamless, user-friendly, and enjoyable designs.

Fundamentals of UI/UX Includes.

- Keep the interface simple. The best interfaces are almost invisible to the user. They avoid unnecessary elements and are clear in the language they use on labels and in messaging.

- Create consistency and use common UI elements. By using common elements in your UI, users feel more comfortable and are able to get things done more quickly.  It is also important to create patterns in language, layout and design throughout the site to help facilitate efficiency. Once a user learns how to do something, they should be able to transfer that skill to other parts of the site. 

- Be purposeful in page layout.  Consider the spatial relationships between items on the page and structure the page based on importance. Careful placement of items can help draw attention to the most important pieces of information and can aid scanning and readability.

- Strategically use color and texture. You can direct attention toward or redirect attention away from items using color, light, contrast, and texture to your advantage.

- Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity. Carefully consider how you use typeface. Different sizes, fonts, and arrangement of the text to help increase scan ability, legibility and readability.

- Make sure that the system communicates what’s happening.  Always inform your users of location, actions, changes in state, or errors. The use of various UI elements to communicate status and, if necessary, next steps can reduce frustration for your user. 

- Think about the defaults. By carefully thinking about and anticipating the goals people bring to your site, you can create defaults that reduce the burden on the user.  This becomes particularly important when it comes to form design where you might have an opportunity to have some fields pre-chosen or filled out.

- Inclusivity. A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is “design for all”—meaning that our design efforts should consider the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals.

- Validation. However impressive a design may seem, it would mean nothing if not validated by user testing. One of the most crucial aspects of UX design is to test proposed solutions with the people who will actually be using them in real life. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensure that the products being made are one’s people will happily want to use. Even after products are released, designers are constantly using methods to assess their success and where improvements can be made.

- Strategy. Designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Therefore, a crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. While an important guideline to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process.

- Empathy. Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.
