The name server IP address is gotten by using the "ping" command on command prompt.
By pinging facebook.com, Google.com and tesla.com, I was able to get their ns IP addresses.

* The ns IP address of Facebook is 102.132.101.35.
* The ns IP address for Google is 142.250.184.174.
* The ns IP address for Tesla is 23.201.26.71


    10.10.10.0
    192.168.0.0
    172.168.1.0

Private IPv4 addresses, also known as RFC 1918 addresses were introduced as a means of conserving IPV4 addresses. This way, an organization can have a single public IP address. Then use IP addresses within the private IPV4 address range within the organization.
